## ðŸŽ¯ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Original Issue**: "We had the idea to bring the recent trading activity in the dashboard to a new structure to show the last X events based on the filter."

**Solution Implemented**: 
âœ… Users can now select exactly how many trades to show (5, 10, 20, 50)
âœ… Users can filter to see specifically the last X buy orders, sell orders, or hold decisions
âœ… Even if recent activity only shows buys and holds, users can still see their last 10 sell orders
âœ… Trading statistics provide quick insights into trading patterns
âœ… Enhanced UI with better styling and user experience

## ðŸš€ HOW TO USE

1. **Select Number of Trades**: Use the "Show" dropdown to choose 5, 10, 20, or 50 trades
2. **Choose View Type**: Use the "View" dropdown to select:
   - "Recent All" for mixed recent activity
   - "Last Buys" to see only your recent buy orders
   - "Last Sells" to see only your recent sell orders  
   - "Last Holds" to see only your recent hold decisions
3. **Monitor Statistics**: Check the summary cards for trading activity overview
4. **Auto-Refresh**: Dashboard updates automatically every 60 seconds

## ðŸ“Š CONFIGURATION

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Dashboard settings
DASHBOARD_TRADE_HISTORY_LIMIT=10
```

This sets the default number of trades to show when the dashboard loads.

## âœ… STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED
