# CONFIGURATION TO ENABLE SELL ORDERS
# Add these to your .env file

# Lower SELL threshold to enable trend-following sells
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD_SELL=50  # Down from 70

# Optional: Also lower BUY threshold for consistency  
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD_BUY=50   # Down from 70

# Alternative: Give more weight to trend-following strategy
# (This would require code changes to implement weighted strategies)

# The main issue: Your trend-following strategy wants to SELL BTC with 85% confidence
# But the combined score is only 21.25% because other strategies vote HOLD
# Lowering the threshold to 50% would allow these SELL orders to execute
